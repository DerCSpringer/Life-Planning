**LIFE PLANNING**

**In the Apple App Store**

In Life Planning you plan your daily schedule with a todo list, habit progression tool, and goal completion system. In Life Planning you start out by creating a goal. For each goal you can schedule habits, which must be completed to reach a goal. For other things which must be completed during the day there is a todo list. 

**Goal**:

• Can be associated with habits

• Displays the progress towards your goal

• Shows your current progress when factoring how well you’re currently doing on all habits associated with the goal

**Habit**: 

• A habit is completed daily

• You can have an alarm for a habit

• Habits can be completed automatically or manually

• If you skip a habit the progress color will change

• Alarms can be automatically set to trigger if you’re doing poorly with a habit

**Todo**:

• Daily todo list with alarms

• A todo can be marked as floating which carries over to the next day if it’s not completed today
